tried and true: 
Replace pork belly with shiitake/veg 
	shiitake-only is super good, but ridiculously expensive 
Use 10g packet of hon-dashi for stock 
Omit gochugaru - perfect spiciness with homemade kimchi (2/3 spiciness) and just gochujang 

to try: 
veg other than shiitake 
less water if using veg 
	same amount of seasonings 
	make up for water from veg 
	dilute if needed 

tried and failed: 
Try using water from second or third round of washing rice for stock -> thickens stew 
	does nothing
