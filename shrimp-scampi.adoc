Serves:: 1

== Ingredients 

* 150g shrimp 
** as large as possible; peeled, deveined, thawed

* 3 Tbsp. butter 
* 1 Tbs. olive oil 
* 3 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1/4 cup white wine 
* 3/4 cup cherry/snack tomatoes 
** make or break the dish - make when tomatoes are in-season 
* red pepper flakes 
* 1/4 lemon 
* salt 
* parsley 

== Instructions 

* If using shrimp shells, make shrimp butter lite - fry the shells in a saucepan with 2 Tbs. butter. Strain butter and set aside. 
** If making legit shrimp butter, it needs to be made at least an hour before. 
* Melt 1 Tbsp. butter and the olive oil in a pan over medium high heat. Add garlic, tomatoes and saut√© for 30 seconds, until fraggrant. Add remaining (shrimp) butter, wine, crushed red pepper. Let simmer until the tomatoes begin to wilt. 
* Add shrimp to pan, season with good pinch of salt. Add half the lemon to the pan, let shrimp cook until opaque (wait until pink a bit over halfway through, flip, cook until done). Stir in parsley and, if needed, season with more salt and lemon to taste.
